# Recipe Import TXT Feature Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Changed Ingredient Field Order ✓
**File:** `utils/edit_dialogs.py`

- Changed ingredient table column headers from `["Ingredient", "Amount"]` to `["Amount", "Ingredient"]`
- Updated the `populate_fields()` method to populate columns in the new order (Amount first, then Ingredient)
- Updated the `get_data()` method to read columns in the correct order
- Updated the `add_ingredient()` method with clear comments indicating which column is which

### 2. Added TXT Import Option ✓
**File:** `panels/cookbook_panel.py`

- Added a new radio button option "Text File / Paste Recipe" to the import dialog
- Updated the file filter in `browse_recipe_import_file()` to support `.txt` files

### 3. Added Text Input Area ✓
**File:** `panels/cookbook_panel.py`

- Added a `QTextEdit` widget for pasting recipe text directly
- The text area includes helpful placeholder text showing the expected format
- Added toggle functionality to show/hide the text input area when TXT radio button is selected
- Text area size: minimum 200px height

### 4. Implemented Text Parser ✓
**File:** `panels/cookbook_panel.py`

Added comprehensive parsing functionality:

#### Main Parser Method: `_parse_recipe_text()`
Supports parsing of the following fields:
- Recipe Name/Title
- Category
- Prep Time
- Cook Time
- Servings
- Difficulty
- Description
- Ingredients (as section)
- Instructions/Directions/Steps/Method
- Notes/Tips

**Format Support:**
- Field format: `Field Name: value` (e.g., "Recipe Name: Gluten-Free Pancakes")
- Section headers: `Ingredients:`, `Instructions:`, `Notes:`, etc.
- Flexible patterns (case-insensitive)

#### Ingredient Parser: `_parse_ingredients_list()`
Parses ingredient lines into structured data:
- Handles bullet points (-, *, •)
- Extracts quantity, unit, and ingredient name
- Pattern: `2 cups gluten-free flour` → `{quantity: "2", unit: "cups", name: "gluten-free flour"}`
- Falls back to simple text if no measurement found

### 5. Import Methods ✓
**File:** `panels/cookbook_panel.py`

#### `import_from_txt(file_path, ...)`
- Reads text from `.txt` file
- Passes content to parser

#### `import_from_txt_content(recipe_text, ...)`
- Parses recipe text using `_parse_recipe_text()`
- Handles duplicate detection (skip, update, or create new)
- Inserts recipe into `recipes` table
- Inserts parsed ingredients into `recipe_ingredients` table
- Shows success/error messages

#### `_toggle_txt_input_mode(checked)`
- Shows/hides text input area based on radio button selection

### 6. Updated Import Flow ✓
**File:** `panels/cookbook_panel.py`

Modified `perform_recipe_import()` to:
- Check if TXT radio button is selected
- Prioritize pasted text over file selection
- Allow either file OR pasted text (not require both)
- Show appropriate validation messages

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with formatted text** - Use the example format above
2. **Test with file upload** - Create a `.txt` file with recipe content
3. **Test with pasted text** - Paste recipe directly into text area
4. **Test duplicate handling** - Import same recipe twice with different settings
5. **Test various formats** - Try different field names and orders
6. **Test minimal input** - Only title and ingredients
7. **Test with bullets** - Use -, *, and • for ingredients

## Database Schema
The import saves to two tables:
- `recipes` table: Main recipe information
- `recipe_ingredients` table: Structured ingredient data (recipe_id, ingredient_name, quantity, unit, notes)

## Benefits
1. **Flexible Input** - Users can paste recipes from any source
2. **File Support** - Can import from `.txt` files
3. **Smart Parsing** - Automatically extracts structured data
4. **Better UX** - Clear placeholder text guides users
5. **Duplicate Handling** - Skip, update, or create new entries
6. **Structured Data** - Ingredients parsed into database-friendly format
