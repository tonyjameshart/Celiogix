    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    severity,
    voiceNote,
    location: await this.getCurrentLocation(),
    context: await this.getContextualData() // Recent meals, time, etc.

  });
  
  // Offline-first risk analysis
  const riskAnalysis = await this.analyzeGlutenRisk(result.content);
  
  // Log performance metrics
  this.trackScanPerformance(Date.now() - startTime, riskAnalysis.confidence);
  
  return riskAnalysis;
}
```

### 3. 🧠 Smart Notifications
```typescript
// Context-aware notifications based on location and patterns
async setupContextualNotifications() {
  // Location-based restaurant alerts
  const location = await Geolocation.getCurrentPosition();
  const nearbyRisks = await this.checkNearbyRestaurantRisks(location);
  
  if (nearbyRisks.length > 0) {
    await this.showAlert(`Near ${nearbyRisks[0].name} - High cross-contamination risk`);
  }
  
  // Pattern-based insights
  const patterns = await this.analyzeRecentPatterns();
  if (patterns.hasCorrelation) {
