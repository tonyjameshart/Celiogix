## **Test Execution Guidelines**

### **Pre-Test Setup**
1. Ensure the application is properly installed
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Clear any existing test data
4. Set up test environment with sample data

### **Common Issues and Troubleshooting**

#### **Import Errors**
- **Issue**: `cannot import name 'pyqtSignal' from 'PySide6.QtCore'`
- **Solution**: This has been fixed in the codebase. If you encounter this error, ensure you have the latest version of the code.

#### **Database Schema Issues**
- **Issue**: `no such column: item` in shopping list
- **Solution**: The database schema includes both `item` and `item_name` columns. The application should handle this automatically, but if issues persist, try:
  1. Delete the existing database file (`data/celiogix.db`)
  2. Restart the application to recreate the database with proper schema

#### **Syntax Errors**
- **Issue**: `expected an indented block after 'except' statement`
- **Solution**: These are typically code formatting issues that have been resolved. If encountered:
  1. Check for proper indentation in Python files
  2. Ensure all try/except blocks have proper indentation
  3. Verify all if statements have indented blocks

#### **Application Launch Issues**
- **Issue**: Application fails to start
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check Python version (3.8+ required)
  2. Install all required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements_pyside6.txt
     pip install -r requirements_encryption.txt
     ```
  3. If cryptography is missing: `pip install cryptography>=41.0.0`
  4. Clear Python cache: `Get-ChildItem 'D:\code' -Recurse -Directory -Filter __pycache__ | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`
  5. Check for missing dependencies in requirements files

#### **Missing Dependencies**
- **Issue**: `No module named 'cryptography'`
- **Solution**: Install the cryptography package:
  ```bash
  pip install cryptography>=41.0.0
  ```
  Or install all dependencies at once:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements_pyside6.txt
  pip install -r requirements_encryption.txt
  ```

#### **Missing Log Directory**
- **Issue**: `[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'logs\\error.log'`
- **Solution**: Create the logs directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir logs
  ```
  Or on Windows:
  ```cmd
  md logs
  ```

#### **Import Path Issues**
- **Issue**: `No module named 'panels.recipe_manager'`
- **Solution**: This is typically caused by incorrect relative imports. The issue has been fixed in the codebase by updating import paths from relative to absolute imports:
  ```python
  # Incorrect (relative import from wrong location)
  from .recipe_manager import RecipeManager
  
  # Correct (absolute import)
  from panels.cookbook.recipe_manager import RecipeManager
  ```

#### **Variable Scope Issues**
- **Issue**: `NameError: name 'current_row' is not defined`
- **Solution**: This occurs when lambda functions reference variables that are not in scope. The issue has been fixed by:
  1. Using proper variable scoping in lambda functions
  2. Creating alternative methods that don't rely on undefined variables
  3. Using recipe IDs instead of row numbers when table context is not available

#### **Data Type Issues**
- **Issue**: `'PySide6.QtWidgets.QSpinBox.setValue' called with wrong argument types: PySide6.QtWidgets.QSpinBox.setValue(str)`
- **Solution**: This occurs when database values are stored as strings but UI components expect integers. The issue has been fixed by:
  1. Converting string values to integers before setting them in QSpinBox components
  2. Using `int(recipe_data.get('servings', 4))` instead of `recipe_data.get('servings', 4)`
  3. Ensuring all numeric database fields are properly converted to appropriate types

#### **String to Integer Conversion Issues**
- **Issue**: `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1 loaf'`
- **Solution**: This occurs when database fields contain text with numbers (like "1 loaf" instead of just "1"). The issue has been fixed by:
  1. Creating a helper method `_extract_numeric_value()` that uses regex to extract numbers from strings
  2. Handling cases where servings might be "1 loaf", "2 pieces", etc.
  3. Providing fallback values when conversion fails
  4. Using `re.findall(r'\d+', value)` to extract the first number from text

#### **Missing Import Issues**
- **Issue**: `name 'get_connection' is not defined`
- **Solution**: This occurs when functions try to use database connection without importing it. The issue has been fixed by:
  1. Adding `from utils.db import get_connection` to all functions that use database connections
  2. Ensuring consistent import patterns across all database-related functions
  3. Adding imports at the function level where needed

#### **Layout Method Issues**
- **Issue**: `'PySide6.QtWidgets.QHBoxLayout' object has no attribute 'addSeparator'`
- **Solution**: This occurs when trying to use `addSeparator()` on layout objects. The issue has been fixed by:
  1. Replacing `addSeparator()` with `addStretch()` for layout objects
  2. Note: `addSeparator()` is valid for `QMenu` objects but not for layout objects
  3. Using `addStretch()` provides visual separation in layouts

#### **Service Initialization Issues**
- **Issue**: `'HealthLogPanel' object has no attribute 'care_provider_service'`
- **Solution**: This occurs when service initialization fails or when services are accessed before initialization. The issue has been fixed by:
  1. **Initialization Order Fix**: Moving service initialization before `super().__init__()` call because `setup_ui()` is called during parent initialization
  2. Adding error handling to service initialization in `__init__` methods
  3. Providing fallback behavior when services are not available
  4. Adding null checks before using service methods
  5. Displaying user-friendly error messages when services fail
  6. **Root Cause**: The BasePanel calls `setup_ui()` during its `__init__()`, which calls methods that need the service, but the service wasn't initialized yet
